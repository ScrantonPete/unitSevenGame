# unitSevenGame

What the project does
This Project demonstrates how to use the Firebase database to store and display information about Train schedules. Moment.js site is also referenced to display tim in proper format and assist with the math formulas when calculatin next train arrival and train minutes away.

Why the project is useful
The project is useful as it helps educate the coder on what can be achieved by utilizing Firebase and Moment.js. It also incorporates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It's also improving my current Bootstrap Portfolio by including a link to the Train Schedule currently under the Hot Yoga picture.

How users can get started with the project
